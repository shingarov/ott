# How to repeat Experiment2

- convince yourself `make` successfully builds `master` (means you have a sane OCaml)
- switch to `experiment2`, then `make`
- `bin/ott -i minimal.ott -o minimalScript.sml`
- `vim minimalScript.sml` and remove everything down from `====== END OF JSON =======`; save as `minimal.json`
